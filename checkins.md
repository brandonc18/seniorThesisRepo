## Week 1 Summary (09/29/2025)

### This week I worked on:

- I searched for websites that I can download free pgn files from.
- Determined how I want my database to be set up, it will include Games, Plays, FEN'S, ELO's, and other less important stats that are contained in PGN files.
- Researched how to translate these PGN files into my database.

### This week I learned:

- https://www.pgnmentor.com/files.html and https://database.lichess.org/ host free downloads for PGN files.
The first site being PGNs for world top players, the second being larger monthly records of all games on that website.
- Python has a chess library, zstandard, io, and sqlite3 that can easily handle translating PGN files.

### My successes this week were:

- Getting a basic understanding of how to proceed, and finding sources to do so.
- Finding the appropriate libraries to create the python script that will start this project.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

- Starting the script for my database creator.
- Trying to determine if I want to use c++ or python for the main part of the project, both have chess libraries that I can explore.
- Learning to understand chess notation for movements.

## Week 2 Summary (10/06/2025)
### This week I worked on:

- My plan for the structure of my chess engine.
- Studied how most chess engines function.

### This week I learned:

- How bitboards can be used to efficiently calculate possible moves.
- Trying to use a markov chain would be to uncertain and would be a brute force method.
- That pieces and board positions have values that help the engine make decisions.
- It is more efficient to calculate psuedo legal moves (moves that a piece could make if there were no obstacles) than straight up calculating legal moves.

### My successes this week were:

- Changing course from Markov to a more traditional chess engine.
- Researching the inner structures of chess engines.
- Choosing c++ as my language to use.

### The challenges I faced this week were:

- Understanding how bitboards work and how to use them.
- Switching course from Markov to Traditional chess engine plan.
- Trying to figure out if I want to use bitboards, or start with something a little simpler yet less efficient.
