## Week 1 Summary (09/29/2025)

### This week I worked on:

[
I looked for sites that I can download free pgn files from.
Determined how I want my database to be set up, it will include Games, Plays, FEN'S, ELO's, and other less important stats that are contained in PGN files.
Researched how to translate these PGN files into my database.
]

### This week I learned:

[
https://www.pgnmentor.com/files.html and https://database.lichess.org/ host free downloads for PGN files.
The first site being PGNs for world top players, the second being larger monthly records of all games on that website.
Python has a chess library, zstandard, io, and sqlite3 that can easily handle translating PGN files.
]

### My successes this week were:

[
Getting a basic understanding of how to proceed, and finding sources to do so.
Finding the appropriate libraries to create the python script that will start this project.
]

### The challenges I faced this week were:

[
Starting the script for my database creator.
Trying to determine if I want to use c++ or python for the main part of the project, both have chess libraries that I can explore.
Learning to understand chess notation for movements.
